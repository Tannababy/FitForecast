## Description

N/A

## Usage

![Demo of FitForecast web application](./assets/images/demoGif.gif)

When the user loads the page, they can see the weather based on their browser location, or input their own location manually. Based on the level of precipitation at the time, the 'Generate Workout' modal window will show the options for either an indoor workout (for precipitation over 25%), or an outdoor workout (for precipitation under 25%).

For indoor workouts, the user is prompted to pick the muscle group they wish to work on, along with one piece of equipment they have available. Then, a workout set of three exercises will appear based on the selected options.

For outdoor workouts, the user is prompted to pick between running, walking, cycling, and wheelchair racing, toghether with a specific length of time for the full workout. Then, a workout set of three exercises will appear based on the selected options.

In the Past Workouts section, users can see the last workout set that was generated, and see each exercise individually by clicking on 'Show exercise'.
